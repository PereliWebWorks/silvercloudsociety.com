      		<h2>History</h2>
      		<div>
      			Although we as a company have existed in some form or another for over a decade before, Lakeview Productions was established in 2003 by director of photography Christopher Gearhart as a venue for his cinematography.  Soon after, clients happy with the level of quality and professionalism wanted Lakeview Productions involved in all aspects of the production process, so we broadened our scope to a full-service production company.  Since then we've been working nonstop on films, commercials, music videos and the like with a primary focus on delivering the highest production values possible for our clients. That may sound like big talk, but our work has won us various awards (including an Emmy nomination). We pride ourselves on our work, and have enjoyed working with clients such as the A1 Steak Sauce, the NHL, the Chicago Bears, HBO, FOX Network, Comcast, and it keeps growing.

      		<h2>Stop Worrying About Production</h2>
      		<div>
      			<div>
  					Does the word "production" start that first tingle of a migraine in your head? Fear not, brave warrior.  We have assembled a set of thoughts to remember when approaching your next visual masterpiece:
  				</div>
      			<div>
      				<h3>We Love What We Do.</h3>
      				<div>
      					Truth be told, we’re total geeks.  There’s a good chance that we actually enjoy the things you dread about production.  We’re in this industry because it’s our passion, and we embrace the challenges that others see as headaches.
      				</div>
      			</div>
      			<div>
      				<h3>We're in the business of problem-solving.</h3>
      				<div>
      					For a production company, just about every step of the production process involves figuring out how to make it happen.  We do this for a living, and solving problems is what we do every day.
      				</div>
      			</div>
      			<div>
      				<h3>We know the industry.</h3>
      				<div>
      					We've been doing this for a while, and we've not only gotten to know our industry, but the industries of our clients as well.  We work with ad agencies, studios and record labels and know what their needs and concerns are. This experience allows us to anticipate and solve issues clients may have, before they become major.
      				</div>
      			</div>
      			<div>
      				<h3>We're flexible.</h3>
      				<div>
      					Our clients vary and logically, so do our projects.  We love to explore different styles and genres, and can work on a broad range of budgets.  We approach each project with fresh eyes and are ready to adjust to its needs.  Your crew, equipment package, creative approach, and budget will be specific for your project and your needs.
      				</div>
      			</div>
      			<div>
      				<h3>We love film, and are filmmakers.</h3>
      				<div>
      					So if you're not making a movie, does this apply? Of course!  Almost any video's production value will be judged on the same merits as a motion picture.  “Filmic” is almost universally synonymous with high-quality production.  Equally important is the way film uses visual language to communicate its message.  TV spots and music videos these days are like short-form movies, and  the good ones share the same qualities as a well made film.
      				</div>
      			</div>
      			<div>
      				<h3>We want you to be happy.</h3>
      				<div>
      					Let’s face it, if you’re happy working with us, you’ll want to work with us again.  It’s just good business.  It's also one of our core values: maintaining good relationships is as important as the quality of our work.
      				</div>
      			</div>
      			<div>
      				<h3>We only aim for the highest quality.</h3>
      				<div>
      					We constantly strive to better ourselves creatively and technically in our art.  We are very prideful of our work and strive for the same level of excellence in all of our projects, no matter the budget.
