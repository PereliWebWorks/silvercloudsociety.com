            At Silver Cloud Society, our mission has always involved more than just creating

            extraordinary films. It's been about the story behind those films. It's about what

            happens behind the camera and the beautiful visuals. It's about the writers, the creative

            visionaries and the social media pros that puts the spotlight on a masterpiece for

            everyone to pay attention to it.

            <div>&nbsp;</div>

            We're recruiting for in-house projects here at Silver Cloud Society. If you're somebody

            whose head remains permanently in the clouds, emerging only to show the world what

            brilliant ideas you've envisioned, then you're our kind of person.

            We're currently working on 9 TOP SECRET astonishing independent films, Hollywood in

            Chicago movement and we'll be making them over the next decade. We're not talking

            about just a job here; we're talking about a career in the entertainment industry. If that

            excites you, then we definitely have a connection.

            <div>&nbsp;</div>

            We want you to join us if you share a passion for filmmaking, and that doesn't have to

            mean directing or acting in films. That could mean writing a blockbuster or maybe even

            an Oscar winning screenplay!

            <div>&nbsp;</div>

            We're not like other companies. We see ourselves as a group of friends, or better yet, a

            large family, rather than a business. And we want you to join us on this journey for the

            next 10 years.

            <div>&nbsp;</div>

            We strive to make modest budget films that'll become massive blockbusters. The

            proceeds from our feature film "The Ghost Story Project" will go towards purchasing

            The Heller House Frank Lloyd Wright's first work in the Hyde Park neighborhood of

            Chicago, an area that was influenced by the Gothic Revival work of Henry Ives Cobb.

            The mansion will quickly become one of Chicago's premier cultural hotspots, a scene of

            lavish parties attended by the city's wealthiest socialites and celebrities.

            This 1897 mansion is perfect studio for our lucrative ventures as well as a building space

            for creative and interesting people.

            <div>&nbsp;</div>

            We welcome you to share in this glorious shining moment.
