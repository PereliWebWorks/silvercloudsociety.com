      	<h3>OUR CRAFT</h3>
      	Watching a film is a lot like dreaming. A good film creates an immersive fantasy that we forget is not real--much like a dream. As we are unaware of how active our mind is while we dream, so the filmmaker works ferociously behind the scenes to create a seamless sensory tapestry.  As the architects of these celluloid dreams, we must strive on both a creative and a technical level.  Only in the union of these two disciplines is the viewer transported into living worlds, emotions, sensations, and thoughts that formerly only dreams could provoke.
